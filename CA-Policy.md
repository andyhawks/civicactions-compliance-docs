## Procedures

As an internet service provider, CivicActions invests in comprehensive risk management
assessments.

Assessments of CivicActions operations may be performed in tandem with vulnerability
scanning, malicious user testing, insider threat assessments, alerts from continuous
monitoring and other tests as defined and regularly conducted by the CivicActions
Information Security and Technology teams. Coordination with third party assessors is
included when required by client contract or applicable laws and regulations.

CivicActions takes any results seriously, and it implements remediations as soon as
possible. Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are maintained to ensure any findings are
resolved, compensated for, or accepted as an operational requirement.

See CA-2, CA-5, CA-7, CA-8.

serves as the Authorizing Official for all CivicActions services.

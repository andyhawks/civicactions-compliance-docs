# Security awareness and training policy

See the [CivicActions Security Training](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-welcome-to-civicactions/training/security-training/) which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Contingency Planning (CP)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

## Purpose

Provide training in modern security practices, ensure announcements regarding new risks to information systems circulate immediately, and facilitate collaboration across CivicActions and its client services to develop new technologies or methodologies to manage risk.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

In addition, the CivicActions Information Security will coordinate with CivicActions
client services as needed.

## Procedures

If CivicActions staff fail to comply with CivicActions security awareness and training
requirements, their access to CivicActions information systems may be terminated.

See AT-2.

CivicActions Operations staff with significant information system security roles may be
required to complete role-based security-related training before being granted access, and
undergo subsequent refresher training annually.

Whenever a new person joins the CivicActions team, they are assigned a Trello board
documenting a checklist of required training materials. The same process is applied to
each team member annually as if they were a new team member.

See AT-3, AT-4.

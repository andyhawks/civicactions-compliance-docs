# Maintenance Policy

Maintenance-specific operational controls concern requirements to design, maintain, and
use systems in a secure environment. The manner in which these controls are implemented
depends on the risks, sensitivity, and criticality associated with the specific systems
and data involved. In some cases, basic security policy controls may need to be modified
or supplemented in order to address application-specific or system-specific requirements.

## Purpose

Not applicable. CivicActions does not maintain hardware and generally utilizes systems
provided by remote hoting or cloud-based IaaS services. See below for a discussion of
software maintenance.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

Software maintenance policy is client specific, and is generall accomplished via the procedures of [Configuration Management (CM)](https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/CM-Policy.md) and [System and Services Acquisition (SA)](https://github.com/CivicActions/compliance-docs/blob/master/SA-Policy.md). Please see those control families for details.

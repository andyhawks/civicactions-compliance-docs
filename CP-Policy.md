# Contingency planning

See the [CivicActions Security Training](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-welcome-to-civicactions/training/security-training/) which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)

Use those scenarios to iteratively improve training, methodologies, but above all - improve the automation of our information systems to self-heal from any disruptions.

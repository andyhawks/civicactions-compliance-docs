# Contingency planning

See the [CivicActions Security Training](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/en/latest/company-policies/new-hire-orientation/security-training/) which covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)

* Contingency Planning (CP)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)

Identify scenarios of likely events that would substantively disrupt the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system. Use those scenarios to iteratively improve training, methodologies, but above all - improve the automation of our information systems to self-heal from any disruptions.

## Scope

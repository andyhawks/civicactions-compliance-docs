# Configuration Management

The CivicActions Configuration Management Policy covers:

* Awareness and Training (AT)
* Configuration Management (CM)
* Contingency Planning (CP)
* Incident Response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media Protection (MP)
* Physical and Environmental Protection (PE)
* Personnel Security (PS)
* System and Information Integrity (SI)

## Purpose

CivicActions works to maintain information systems in an immutable state as much as
feasible. To the greatest degree possible, the configuration of systems should be
maintained in code so that at any time they can be rebuilt and replaced from a known and
secure baseline state.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

The CivicActions team uses the agile scrum methodology to govern configuration changes
with configuration captured in code and issue tickets. In some cases, a detailed
Configuration Plan document will be created to detail specific needs for a client.

See CM-6, CM-9. 

A current baseline configuration is always available such that the site can be regenerated
or rolled back should unauthorized or failing changes be applied.

See CM-2.

CivicActions Technology Operations works with relevant stakeholders, decision-makers, and CivicActions Information Security to determine any necessary changes, and their impacts, to the configuration of the system. All changes to the configuration of the system are tracked in GitHub. Only the System Owner and CivicActions Technology Operations are allowed to make configuration changes, and all changes are made to reasonably ensure the configurations require the least amount of functionality necessary.

See CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-7, CM-8.

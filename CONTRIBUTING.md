## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the CivicActions Common Security Controls! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [CivicActions Code of Conduct](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/en/latest/company-policies/code-of-conduct/) and all contributors must do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [CivicActions Guidebook](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:support@civicactions.com).

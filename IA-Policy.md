# Identification and Authentication Policy

CivicActions systems incorporate proper user identification and authentication
methodology.  In some cases, basic security policy controls may need to be modified or
supplemented in order to address application-specific or system-specific requirements.
Typically, the following operational control families are implemented and monitored by
personnel responsible for administering and operating a system, such as the network,
system, and application administrators, system and data owners, ISSOs, and custodians.

* Access Control (AC)
* Audit and Accountability (AU)
* Identification and Authentication (IA)
* System and Communications Protection (SC)

## Purpose

Balance restrictions designed to prevent unauthorized access against the need to provide
unhindered access to informational assets.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

In addition, the CivicActions Information Security will coordinate with CivicActions
client services as needed.

## Procedures

In accordance with the [CivicActions Security and Compliance policy for
Developers](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05-engineering/security-compliance/),
CivicActions internal users are uniquely identified by creation of an organizational
account with a username based on each user's first and last name and an email based on
their civicactions.com email address.

Privileged user accounts are audited and privileges removed when no longer applicable.

# CivicActions Common Control Policy

CivicActions has implemented and documented a set of common control policies. All policies are disseminated to employees and contractors via the [CivicActions Guidebook](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/) and through required re-occuring internal trainings.

CivicActions Information Security works to ensure policies stay current given any updates to law, regulation, or operational procedures.

These policies are managed as part of the general information security policy for all of CivicActions and its client services, particularly when indicated by contract, regulation or law.

## Purpose

To ensure the consistency of all information security policies.

## Scope

All CivicActions employees and contractors are subject to these policies as required by
contract, regulation or law.

When applicable, this Security Policy applies to all CivicActions employees and
contractors or vendors who manage, maintain, operate, or protect CivicActions' systems,
services and data.

## Roles and responsibilities

The CivicActions Office of the Chief Information Security Officer, otherwise known as CivicActions Information Security, is responsible for ensuring that all employees and contracts are familiar and trained in these policies, and to ensure that appropriate procedures are established and tested.

## Management commitment

The CivicActions Chief Information Security Officer is ultimately responsible for these policies. 

## Coordination 

CivicActions Information Security works in close coordination and collaboration with CivicActions Information Technology, Development and Operations (collectively called "Operations" in these policies), and is home to multiple infrastructure and security experts. Implementations and recommendations for policy additions and improvements are constantly coordinated between the teams.

## Compliance

The CivicActions Director of Technology is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the procedures of all CivicActions systems adhere to these policies. The CivicActions Director of Technology accepts the risk of operating all Low and Moderate impact systems and reviews for compliance before granting an authority to operate (ATO).	

## Reviews

The CivicActions Information Security and Operations teams review all policies and procedures when new ATOs are required, or once every 3 years, whichever comes first. The teams also review modifications to policies and procedures when modifications become necessary due to changes in law, regulation, or operations.

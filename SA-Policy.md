# System and Services Acquisition

 CivicActions may work with clients to develop and documant a services acquisition policy
 when needed which covers:

* Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments (CA)
* Planning (PL)
* Program Management (PM)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* System and Services Acquisition (SA)

## Purpose

Continue forming teams of cross-functional skill sets that include security and privacy
experts. Always keep a reserve of funding, time, and staff in order to provide for
unexpected increases in the need for architectural and security engineering assistance, at
any phase in an information system development life cycle.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

CivicActions active client development processes usually employ two-week planning
sprints. Before each sprint, work is prioritized, inclusive of security needs.

See SA-2.

When applicable, CivicActions practices a Scrum process when developing new features or
fixing existing issues, including security fixes and enhancements.  Each feature or issue
is assigned to a card in the system, where it goes through a process of being identified,
prioritized, explored, delivered, and finally demonstrated. Each card is reviewed by the
team as a whole throughout its lifecycle to identify any security risks or concerns, which
are recorded on the card as "acceptance criteria" that must be addressed before
development is complete.
  
Once development is complete, a team member submits the code to the version control system
as a "pull request", where preferred practice is to have at least one other team member
further reviews it before merging it into the code base. New features are deployed into
our staging area where they undergo further security review and stakeholder acceptance
testing, as well as automated acceptance tests.  The System Owner is responsible for
ensuring appropriate staffing for security needs. The CivicActions Operations team
implements, configures, and maintains security controls.

As part of CivicActions account management and access control, each service has a list of
privileged accounts with the identities of the CivicActions team members who have those
privileges. See AC and IA control families for more details.

See SA-3.

Active CivicActions project teams employ the agile development processes. Changes are made
early, often, and iteratively. Functions, ports, and protocols are part of this
process. All such configuration is captured in version control and deployed in a an
automated process.

See SA-4.

CivicActions Operations always obtains complete documentation, including administrator and user
documentation, for any technology that is used within any product or service. The maintenance of
administrator- and user- facing documentation, in the form of version-controlled changes
in a code repository or our documentation repository, is an assumed requirement for all
changes. Currently, CivicActions only uses technology whose documentation can be shared
publicly.  CivicActions values transparency and collaboration.

See SA-5.

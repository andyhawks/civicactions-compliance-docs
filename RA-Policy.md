# Risk assessment policy

When contract, regulations or law require, CivicActions will perform risk assessments on
supplied products and services. These assessments may cover one or more controls within
these families:

* Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments (CA)
* Planning (PL)
* Program Management (PM)
* Risk Assessment (RA)
* System and Services Acquisition (SA)

## Purpose

Provide governance over a formal, documented risk assessment structure that addresses
purpose, scope, controls, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination and
compliance.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

Initial security categorization is a collaborative and inter-disciplinary activity, with
all final decisions made by the Authorizing Official. Risk assessment is similarly
cross-functional, with the Operations team being primarily responsible, as directed by the
Project Manager. The CivicActions Information Security team are consulted throughout, and
the Authorizing Official seeks to minimize any need to issue waivers or risk acceptances
that do not have concurrence from the Product Owner or Chief Information Security Officer.

See RA-2, RA-3.

CivicActions Operations and Information Security work together to scan all of relevant
portions of the product or service stack.

Access to scanning tools, scan results, and logs is broadly shared amongst the CivicActions
team to ensure a rapid response to any findings. Similarly, on-demand access is granted to
the Authorizing Official to aide in any systemic understanding of the system's risk
posture.

See RA-5.

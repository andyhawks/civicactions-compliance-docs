found violating CivicActions policies, procedures, or taking any other action that
knowingly violates the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems.

## Scope

See the [CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Policy overlay

For information on roles and responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
organizational entities, compliance, reviews, and updates please see the
[CivicActions Common Control Policy](CivicActions-Common-Control-Policy.md).

## Procedures

For personnel categorization, position risk designation is assigned by CivicActions management. Risk designations are re-categorized whenever responsibilities change or when the impact level of the system or the information in it changes.

See PS-2, PS-3.

Review of ongoing operational need for current logical access by individuals are initiated and facilitated by the System Owner and Project Manager. The System Owner or Project Manager modifies permissions granted to individuals to correspond any changes in the individual requirements.

See PS-5.

CivicActions enforces the same requirements on contractors that it does on staff, and contractors follow all normal procedures for onboarding and gaining access to client systems.

See PS-7.

The Management Ops Team is responsible for determining and enforcing sanctions for
failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures. Coaching
may be considered prior to sanctions. Sanctions may include but are not limited to written
warnings, reduction in system access, demotion, or termination.

See PS-8 and PS-4.
